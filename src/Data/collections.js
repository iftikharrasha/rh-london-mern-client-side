The shift has been so significant, in fact, beauty bookings service Treatwell reported a 432% spike in bookings after salons were given a reopening date. Of course, should all things go to plan with the government’s ‘roadmap’, the majority of lockdown restrictions will be completely lifted on June 21st—for the first time since the pandemic began—meaning life, love, work and play should be able return to ‘normal’ And, understandably, the industry is seeing a second spike in Brits are wanting to look their very best for the occasion. It’s not just well-groomed men and women looking for a fresh ‘cut, either. Bookings for high-ticket beauty treatments that do more than your everyday facial or massage are doubling, tripling and quadrupling, compared to pre-pandemic figures. From innovative radio frequency treatments for the face and body to transformative hair extension techniques, high-ROI beauty treatment bookings are booming in the capital. Inside the three-story townhouse stylists Daniel Argenio and Melinda Badger offer everything you’d expect from a full-service salon, yet specialize in Richy Hair (largely considered the world’s most prestigious hair extension brand). And appointments are filling up faster than ever, thanks to frequent paparazzi snaps of its well-tressed celebrity clientele leaving the salon. From full-heads of tape extensions to a few carefully placed extensions to disguise pandemic-era hair loss, the stylists have never been in higher demand.",

Put your hair in the hands of someone subpar, however, and you can leave feeling utterly distraught. The good news, however, is that London is bursting with reputable salons and hairdressers we're more than confident to recommend you trust your precious locks with. Here's our guide to the best hair salons in London – you're welcome. Vogue editors choose to get their hair cut at Hershesons – and with good reason. The 5,000 sq ft super-salon on Berners Street caters to far more than just hair, boasting a DryBy nail bar, Farm Girl café, Suman Brows station and Sunday Riley skincare. Cut, colour and styling services are second-to-none, and visitors can enjoy a generous library of magazines and coffee table tomes during their appointment. You could really spend all day here – and why not? Hershesons also has an outpost at Harvey Nichols and a Belgravia branch is poised to open this autumn. Vying for London’s most impressive salon storefront, RH London specialises in ethical Richy Hair – considered one of the world’s most prestigious hair extension brands, available in no less than 42 shades for a perfect colour match. Positioned on west London's supremely smart Walton Street, the salon is spread across a three-storey townhouse.

The salon stocks the entire Davines product line – an indication of its commitment to chemical-free, eco-conscious products.",

        desc1: "In the mood to switch up your hairstyle? Add instant volume, body, and length with hair extensions. But with so many options out there, it's hard to sift through and choose the right ones for your desired style and budget. Thankfully, there are ways to narrow it down from the get-go. According to celebrity hairstylist César Ramirez, the first choice you'll need to make is whether the look you want requires tape-in extensions, which last around six to eight weeks, or clip-ins, if you prefer to switch it up. From there, you'll need to decide if you want synthetic hair (which is less expensive but tends to be lower-quality), natural human hair (which is pricier but can be styled with hot tools as well as dyed), or a mix of both. FYI, if the highest-quality option is what you're after, choose Remy hair, which is human hair that has its cuticles intact and has never been dyed or processed in any way. (Pro tip: Ramirez suggests having your extensions cut along with your hair by a stylist.) Yes, it's a lot to think about, but we got you—we researched the top options on the market for every hair color, type, and texture. While the general rule with hair extensions is that you get what you pay for, you can find quality that’s a little more affordable. While Vario might not have the varied options of some of the more expensive brands, the brand still offers the high quality, double-weft human hair. So, go on, whip your new hair back and forth while you save some pennies.",

        desc1: "We grow our hair for years and as soon as it reaches peak length, we fancy chopping it into a long-bob again. Long, luscious hair looks so sleek but a choppy bob just seems so trendy - we just can’t decide. Well, thanks to hair extensions (tapes especially) we can now make impulse decisions like these without having to wait a lifetime for our hair to grow back. If you look at pictures of Stella Maxwell and Meghan Markle wishing you had long and bouncy waves just like theirs, now you can. In fact, you can pop to the salon on your lunch break and walk out with locks down to your waist if you so desire. Hair extensions have come a long way in the past five years - they are much more accessible and affordable now. There are also many more varieties available - from clip-ins, bonds and tapes to wigs, nanorings and weaves, the list goes on. If you’ve decided you want longer hair with the use of extensions and you know exactly what type of extension you want to go for, the next step is where to get them done. We’ve selected our five favourite places in London to get hair extensions. If you have made an impulse decision and want new longer hair on your lunch break or while you’re shopping - then you’ve got to head to The Hair Extension Lab at the newly launched Beauty Club London. They offer a speedy in and out experience - you can have a full head of extensions fitted in around 45 minutes. Plus they have the best colourists in London and use the best quality hair and the team are very friendly and attentive. ",

And Lizzie continued with the pampering on Wednesday as she posed outside the R.H Salon in London's Knightsbridge as she excitedly made the most of the easing of lockdown rules. The TV personality, 52, cut a typically glamorous figure for her appointment, wowing  in a leopard print top and skintight leather trousers. Lizzie kept off the chill by adding a fringed leather jacket to her look, while her narrow waist was cinched in by a black belt with a gold buckle. The stunner boosted her height with a pair of killer black pointed Louboutin heels and added a touch of bling with a gold ring and bracelet. Ever the exhibitionist, Lizzie sultrily strutted up and down the street, showcasing her incredible physique. She then accepted a flower from a gentleman working on the salon's impressive jungle-themed floral display. Lizzie's outing comes after she was one of the first in the country queuing up to have a post-lockdown makeover as businesses reopened on Monday. The media star dressed up for the occasion in a silver sequin mini dress as she arrived at The Lisa Harris Skin Science clinic in Weybridge for the pamper session. Lizzie put on a leggy display in the silver mini dress which she teamed with glittering heels. The former WAG enhanced her sun-kissed glow with a smoky eye and styled her ombre locks in relaxed loose waves. While many will wait until the retail and beauty sectors reopen on Monday morning, Lizzie decided to venture out into the depths of night to mark the celebration.",

The hair and beauty industry have had it tough and as we are a new business, it’s been particularly challenging to set up a brand new salon in the middle of a pandemic, but we feel that with our inspiring Christmas shop front build, which has hope at its heart it will bring some joy to people”, explains Armand Beasley, Business Development Director at RH London Warren Bushaway at London Event Florist has installed the stunning creation which will be formally switched on at 3.30pm on the 2nd December.",
