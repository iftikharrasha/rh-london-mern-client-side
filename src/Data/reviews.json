I completely love sitting in the chair with Melinda she is an expert colourist and Vincent always makes my hair look wonderful for a special occasion “ do”, Armand a total talent in creating my overall look and helping my confidence soar. A place where I am comfortable, feel safe and well looked after. It’s definitely a 5-star visit treat for me when I’m in London.",
